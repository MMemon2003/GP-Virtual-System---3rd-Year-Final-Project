## Backend – Laravel Project
This folder contains the backend of the GP Virtual System, built with the Laravel PHP framework.

What is Laravel?
Laravel is a modern PHP framework used for building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications.
It provides built-in tools for:
Authentication & Security (login, encryption, validation)
Database Management using Eloquent ORM
Routing (mapping URLs to functions)
MVC Architecture (Model–View–Controller separation)
REST APIs for communication with the frontend

Why Laravel in this project?
Laravel was chosen because it:
Makes user authentication and logins easier (for doctors/patients).
Connects efficiently with MySQL databases for storing medical records.
Allows integration with the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) through routes and APIs.
Provides a clean project structure for long-term maintenance.

Backend Structure:
The Laravel project has the following main folders:
app/ → Application logic (models, controllers, middleware)
routes/ → Web and API routes (defines system URLs)
resources/ → Views and frontend blade templates (if used with Laravel)
config/ → Configuration files (database, app settings)
database/ → Migrations and seeders for MySQL tables
public/ → Entry point (index.php) and public assets
vendor/ → External dependencies (ignored in GitHub, restored with composer install)

Important Files:
composer.json → Defines project dependencies (Laravel, Guzzle, etc.)
.env (local only) → Environment file for database, mail, and app keys
artisan → Laravel’s command-line tool for managing the backend
